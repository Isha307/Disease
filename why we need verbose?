By setting verbose 0, 1 or 2 you just say how do you want to 'see' the training progress for each epoch.

verbose=0 will show you nothing (silent)

verbose=1 will show you an animated progress bar like this:

progres_bar [=====================]

verbose=2 will just mention the number of epoch like this:

Epoch 1/10
