***** Tuberculosis(TB) CHEST X-RAY DATABASE

A team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh along with their collaborators from Malaysia in collaboration with medical doctors from Hamad Medical Corporation and Bangladesh have created a database of chest X-ray images for Tuberculosis (TB) positive cases along with Normal images. In our current release, there are 3500 TB images, and 3500 normal images.

** Tuberculosis(TB) data:
-----------------------
3500 TB data are collected from different publicly accessible dataset.
-2800 CXR images are collected from NIAID TB portal program dataset[3].
-306 CXR images from BELARUS TB portal program dataset[2].
-394 CXR image from NLM[1]
 


*** Normal images:
---------------------------------------- 
3500 Normal data are collected from from two different dataset.
-406 CXR images are collected from NLM [1]
-3094 CXR images are collected from RSNA [4]

*** Formats
    - All the images are in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file format and resolution are 512*512 pixels.

*** Objective
 -  Researchers can use this database to produce useful and impactful scholarly work on Tuberculosis(TB), which can help in tackling this issue.
